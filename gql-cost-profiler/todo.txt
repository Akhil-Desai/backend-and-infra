1. Install a GQL parsing library

2. Understand the parts of GQL query (i.e Fragements, variables)
    -Fragment is like an object for a query it can define multiple fields
        - If a fragment is presented must parse the fields within to assing a cost
    -variables are things we can include in the query to search for certain things within
        - Consider we might charge more or less for a query that provides variable/s

3. Extract and Log the operation names and variables for each query
